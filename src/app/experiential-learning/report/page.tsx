            <p className="text-mid text-lg leading-relaxed">
              While medical treatments are essential for many, the data tells a troubling story. There is a widening gap
              between demand and supply in NHS services — with long wait times and rising disability claims for mental
              ill-health. Antidepressant use has more than doubled since 2015, yet the prevalence of common mental health
              disorders continues to climb year on year.
            </p>
            <p className="text-mid text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Among young people, probable mental disorder prevalence nearly doubled between 2017 and 2023 — from 12.5%
              to 20.3% for 8–16 year olds, and from 10.1% to 23.3% for 17–19 year olds. These trends highlight an
              urgent need for complementary, non-medical strategies.

              Why Experiential Learning Works

            <div className="bg-blue-pale rounded-2xl p-6 border border-blue/10">
              <p className="text-mid leading-relaxed">
                <strong className="text-black">Experiential learning</strong> is a structured cycle in which
                individuals <em>do</em> (engage in purposeful, often novel activity), <em>reflect</em> (analyse
                the experience), <em>conceptualise</em> (draw general principles) and <em>apply</em> (transfer
                insights to new situations).
              </p>
            </div>
            <p className="text-mid text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Science shows that the brain, like the body, thrives on stimulation. Just as physical exercise
              strengthens muscles, engaging in challenging experiences triggers{' '}
              <strong className="text-black">neuroplasticity</strong> — forming new neural connections, boosting
              cognitive flexibility, and promoting emotional resilience. Without such mental exercise, neural
              pathways weaken, reducing our ability to adapt to and navigate life&apos;s complexities.
            </p>
            <p className="text-mid text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Through carefully designed experiential learning programmes, Empowr introduces individuals to fresh
              challenges that stimulate brain activity at a cellular level. This activation leads to the creation
              of new neural pathways, improving brain function, reducing stress hormones, and enhancing the
              body&apos;s natural ability to stay adaptable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-mid text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Without regular and meaningful stimulation, our neural connections weaken, and our ability to grow,
              cope, and thrive diminishes. That&apos;s why we create hands-on experiences that keep people
              thinking, moving, and connecting — nurturing sharper minds, stronger bodies, and deeper human
              connection.
