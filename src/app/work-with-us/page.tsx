                  Working with Empowr is not just a role — it is a relationship.
                  We take seriously the responsibility of bringing people into a
                  CIC whose work directly affects communities. That means being
                  clear about what we expect, transparent about how we operate,
                  and genuinely invested in the people who show up for us.

                  Whether you are delivering a session, coordinating a
                  programme, or giving a few hours of your time — you are
                  representing something that matters. We will make sure you
                  understand what that is before any work begins.
