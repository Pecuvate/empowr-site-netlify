# Contact — `/contact`

**Purpose:** Makes it easy to reach Empowr. Single form routes to the right inbox by subject.  
**Audience:** Anyone wanting to get in touch — participants, media, partners, funders, practitioners.

## Sections

### 1. Contact Form
- Cream background, full min-height, centred `max-w-2xl` column — no hero banner
- Headline: *"Get In Touch"* (inline, not a separate section)
- Sub-copy: "Fill in the form below and your message will reach the right person. We aim to respond within 2 working days."
- Fields: Name · Email · Subject (dropdown) · Message
- Submit states: idle → submitting (button disabled) → success message or inline error with fallback email link
- Subject routing (handled by `netlify/functions/contact.ts`):
  - Work With Us → `opportunities@empowrcic.org`
  - General Enquiry, Partnership, Media → `enquiries@empowrcic.org`
- Confirmation email sent to sender via Resend on every submission

### Query param pre-fill
All params are optional and independent:
- `?subject=Partnership` — pre-selects the subject dropdown (validated against allowed values)
- `?message=...` — pre-fills the message textarea (any string, user can edit)
- `?source=wix` — attribution tag, not shown in the form UI; validated as a short alphanumeric/hyphen token (max 32 chars), invalid values silently dropped. Forwarded to `netlify/functions/contact.ts`, which re-validates server-side and adds a "Source: {tag}" line to the internal notification email (not the sender's confirmation email) when present.
- Params can be combined, e.g. `?subject=Partnership&message=...&source=prospectus`

Current wired links:
- `/partner-with-us` "Get In Touch" → `/contact?subject=Partnership`
- `/work-with-us` role cards + bottom CTA → `/contact?subject=Work%20With%20Us`
- Empowr CIC Wix site (legacy shop/booking, `empowrcic.wixsite.com/empowrcic`) → `/contact?source=wix` (page content, not yet wired into a query-param link at time of writing — see `guides/contact-routing.md`)

Note: `/prospectus` no longer links to the contact form. Its enquiry/commissioning CTAs go directly to `mailto:outreach@empowrcic.org` (reverted 2026-07-20 — the outreach inbox is active). The `?source=` attribution param itself remains valid and in use elsewhere (e.g. the Wix site above).
